## Purpose / Background :bulb:

- Working in collaboration with a composer and specialist in the [Schillinger System of Musical Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schillinger_System), the aim of this project is to develop an application which can generate rhythms based on user input, and serve as a tool for creative inspiration as well as teaching Joseph Schillinger's rhythmic theory.
- To demonstrate that varied and effective rhythms can be created from almost any series of numbers, the app is designed to take user input in the form of a sequence of digits, which could be entered manually (e.g. 1240652) or come from a less manual/predictable 'in-world' source, such as a barcode. You really can create a rhythm from a can of beans, without needing to hit it! 
- User-generated beats are represented in the sequencer, against a consistent 'pulse' rhythm.
- Each individual number in the sequence defines the length of a beat division and therefore the length of the 'rest' before each subsequent beat - for example: 
  - '0' contains no information for beats or rests, and is therefore ignored;
  - '1' defines a single beat which is followed immediately by another beat/number;
  - '2' defines a beat followed by a rest, taking up 2 beat divisions in total;
  - '3' defines a beat followed by a rest of 2 beat divisions, taking up 3 beat divisions in total;
  - '4 defines a beat followed by a rest of 3 beat divisions, taking up 4 beat divisions in total;
  - etc.
